# Password Checker

This executable communicates with mIRC using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). 
It joins the channel provided in the options window and listens for commands of other people in the channel.
When the users submit a link and a username/password, it validates it and gives points to the user. The users may use these points to see links submitted by other users.
